The analysis and data collection were sampled from all eligible arthroplasty cases from the commencement date of the study to the time of initial analysis. It is asserted that the setting is representative of orthopaedic care in Australia and possesses sufficient equivalence for consideration internationally.\n\n## STROBE \\[6\\] Participants:\n\n<!--# Critique the definition of the study population, including inclusion and exclusion criteria. -->\n\nPatients were approached to participate if they were booked to undergoing primary lower limb total joint arthroplasty (hip or knee) within the orthopaedic department and were presenting for preoperative anaesthetic workup between November 2020 and June 2023 under the care of a surgeon contributing to the department registry (SHARKS).\n\nPatients were excluded for the following reasons\n\n-   Underwent surgery for different condition\n\n-   Surgery was not primary\n\n-   Surgery did not go ahead as planned (not rescheduled within recruitment time period) \\| removed from surgery wait list\n\n-   Comorbidity specific to the urinary system\n\n-   Underwent surgery under the care of a consultant not contributing to the registry\n\n-   Did not possess adequate English skills to answer the PROMs\n\n## STROBE \\[7\\] Variables:\n\n<!--# Evaluate the choice of exposure, outcome, and confounding variables. -->\n\nBefore the commencement of data collection, a [core dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x3LChn3Zh7qPkVQ4rRM0MyjdpfpR-myoZp7oAkq_fKc/edit?usp=sharing \"Study core dataset\") for the study was derived and agreed to by the project investigators to establish the key variables for the study.\n\n### Exposure\n\nThe primary exposure variable was the status of in-dwelling catheterisation prior to the arthroplasty procedure (*preemptive IDC*). Patients were pre-emptively catheterised based on the preference of the treating surgeon in collaboration with the attending anaesthetist.\n\nThe secondary exposure variable was the status of in-dwelling catheterisation as a treatment for *postoperative urinary retention* (POUR) detected immediately after the arthroplasty procedure.\n\nPOUR was defined clinically by the treating consultant in collaboration with the shift nursing staff.\n\n### Outcome(s)\n\nThe primary outcome was the total score derived from the core lower urinary tract symptom score (CLSS) [@homma2008]. The CLSS is a 11-question self-reported questionnaire that provides overall assessment of relevant symptoms of the lower urinary tract.\n\n### Model Covariates\n\n## STROBE \\[8\\] Data Sources/Measurement\n\nData for the study were retrieved in the first instance to a cloud-based file (Sheets, Google LLC, USA).

No other variables relevant to the regression were missing values. Importantly, even though the proportion of missingness is relatively low (\\<10% for postoperative assessment), this should not be used as a guide with respect to deciding whether to use imputation

Management\n\nMultiple imputation under the assumption of *missing at random* as described in [@cro2020].

Estimated versus observed CLSS Total for the analysis cohort.\n\n## STROBE \\[10\\] Study size:\n\n<!--# *Critically analyze the final study sample and the rationale/methods used for its justification.* -->\n\nThe original study sample calculation (Study Plan) estimated that *330* cases would be required to answer Question 1.\n\nDue to delays associated with elective surgery restrictions as part of COVID19 mitigation strategies and rotation of key personnel associated with the study away from the hospital, the sample was restricted to `nrow(MasterFilter)`. The *pwrss* package (v0.3.1) [@pwrss] was used to estimate the power available for the intended regression model to answer Question 2 under the following assumptions.\n\n-   Effect size = small\n\n-   Factor levels = 2\n\n-   Covariates = 4 (see data model)\n\n-   n = 286\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\nPower for the 2-group comparison was 0.84.\n\nThe available sample size should be sufficient to answer the question posed, under the assumptions of the data model proposed here.\n:::\n\n\n\n## STROBE \\[11\\] Quantitative variables:\n\n<!--# *Evaluate the analytical choices of the quantitative variables within the dataset.* -->\n\nTo answer Question 1, a minimal clinically important difference is required for the CLSS. In the original study protocol, a 2-point difference was put forward as a difference sufficient to represent clinically meaningful change in the CLSS Total score (\\~10%).\n\n## STROBE \\[12\\] Statistical Methods:\n\n<!--# *Evaluate the appropriateness and robustness of the statistical techniques used for analysis.* -->\n\nThe participant flow chart was generated using the *consort* package (see STROBE 8).\n\nBaseline data was compared between groups of preemptive IDC (Yes \\| No) using student t-test for continuous variables and fisher exact test (binary categorical) or chi-square test (categorical with \\>2 categories) with correction for ties. Correction for multiple comparisons was implemented with the *Holm* method using the *gtsummary* package (v2.1.0) [@gtsummary].\n\nComplete case analysis of the CLSS Total involved an unadjusted comparison between pre and post scores using a paired t-test.\n\nA linear model was fitted to the imputed data using *stats* (v4.4.2) [@stats] with the following form.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nCLSSMod <- with(\n  MasterImp, \n  exp = lm(PostCLSS ~ PreIDC + BaseCLSS + Bilateral + Sex + AgeAtSurgery)\n    )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThe model was summarised using *gtsummary*.
