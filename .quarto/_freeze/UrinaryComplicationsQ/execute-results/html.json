It is asserted that the setting is representative of orthopaedic care in Australia and possesses sufficient equivalence for consideration internationally.\n\n## STROBE \\[6\\] Participants:\n\n<!--# Critique the definition of the study population, including inclusion and exclusion criteria. -->\n\nPatients were approached to participate if they were booked to undergoing primary lower limb total joint arthroplasty (hip or knee) within the orthopaedic department and were presenting for preoperative anaesthetic workup between November 2020 and June 2023 under the care of a surgeon contributing to the department registry (SHARKS).\n\nPatients were excluded for the following reasons\n\n-   Underwent surgery for different condition\n\n-   Surgery was not primary\n\n-   Surgery did not go ahead as planned (not rescheduled within recruitment time period) \\| removed from surgery wait list\n\n-   Comorbidity specific to the urinary system\n\n-   Underwent surgery under the care of a consultant not contributing to the registry\n\n-   Did not possess adequate English skills to answer the PROMs\n\n## STROBE \\[7\\] Variables:\n\n<!--# Evaluate the choice of exposure, outcome, and confounding variables. -->\n\nBefore the commencement of data collection, a [core dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x3LChn3Zh7qPkVQ4rRM0MyjdpfpR-myoZp7oAkq_fKc/edit?usp=sharing \"Study core dataset\") for the study was derived and agreed to by the project investigators to establish the key variables for the study.\n\n### Exposure\n\nThe primary exposure variable was the status of in-dwelling catheterisation prior to the arthroplasty procedure (*preemptive IDC*). Patients were pre-emptively catheterised based on the preference of the treating surgeon in collaboration with the attending anaesthetist.\n\nThe secondary exposure variable was the status of in-dwelling catheterisation as a treatment for *postoperative urinary retention* (POUR) detected immediately after the arthroplasty procedure.\n\nPOUR was defined clinically by the treating consultant in collaboration with the shift nursing staff.\n\n### Outcome(s)\n\nThe primary outcome was the total score derived from the core lower urinary tract symptom score (CLSS) [@homma2008]. The CLSS is an 11-question self-reported questionnaire that provides overall assessment of relevant symptoms of the lower urinary tract.\n\n### Model Covariates\n\nAlthough there was an attempt to construct a DAG (directed acyclic graph) [@tennant2020] during the study plan, it was decided to revise the graph as part of this analysis. The *ggdag* package (v0.2.13) [@ggdag] combined with *ggplot2* (v3.5.1) were used to create the DAG and calculate the minimum adjustment set, with *knitr* (v1.49) [@knitr] used to display the figures.\n\nThe candidate variables were summarised in the table below\n\n| Variable | Related to PreIDC | Related to Postop Symptoms | Comments |\n|----|----|----|----|\n| Age | Related to risk of POUR [@cha2020] | Assumed |  |\n| Sex | Related to risk of POUR [@cha2020] | Assumed |  |\n| BMI (Body Mass Index) | Associated with POUR in males [@scholten2018] | Unknown | Other studies have not detected relationship between BMI and POUR |\n| Bilateral | Simultaneous bilateral procedures | Unknown |  |\n| Joint | Related to risk of POUR [@peng2022] |  |  |\n| BaseCLSS | Not seen by clinicians | Assumed | Included to reduce model standard errors |\n| Comorbidities | Related to risk of POUR [@tischler2016] | Assumed |  |\n| IntraopFluid | *Intent* or perceived likelihood of high volume may influence decision |  | Possible mediator variable |\n| POUR | The perceived risk of POUR is likely a factor in decision | POUR occurrence assumed to be associated with PROMs | Possible mediator variable |\n| IDCComplic | In-dwelling catheterisation increases infection risk [@ma2019] | Assumed | Possible mediator variable |\n| SpinalAnaesthesia | Associated with POUR [@scholten2018] |  | Possible mediator variable; Unless decision to PreIDC is based on SpinalAnaes *intent* |\n\n: Summary of candidate variables\n\nDefine the graph\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](UrinaryComplicationsQ_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nCreate minimal adjustment set\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](UrinaryComplicationsQ_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## STROBE \\[8\\] Data Sources/Measurement\n\nData for the study were retrieved in the first instance to a cloud-based file (Sheets, Google LLC, USA).

No other variables relevant to the regression were missing values. Importantly, even though the proportion of missingness is relatively low (\\<10% for postoperative assessment), this should not be used as a guide with respect to deciding whether to use imputation

Management\n\nMultiple imputation under the assumption of *missing at random* as described in [@cro2020].

Estimated versus observed CLSS Total for the analysis cohort.\n\n## STROBE \\[10\\] Study size:\n\n<!--# *Critically analyze the final study sample and the rationale/methods used for its justification.* -->\n\nThe original study sample calculation (Study Plan) estimated that *330* cases would be required to answer Question 1.\n\nDue to delays associated with elective surgery restrictions as part of COVID19 mitigation strategies and rotation of key personnel associated with the study away from the hospital, the sample was restricted to `nrow(MasterFilter)`. The *pwrss* package (v0.3.1) [@pwrss] was used to estimate the power available for the intended regression model to answer Question 2 under the following assumptions.\n\n-   Effect size = small\n\n-   Factor levels = 2\n\n-   Covariates = 4 (see data model)\n\n-   n = 286\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\nPower for the 2-group comparison was 0.84.\n\nThe available sample size should be sufficient to answer the question posed, under the assumptions of the data model proposed here.\n:::\n\n\n\n## STROBE \\[11\\] Quantitative variables:\n\n<!--# *Evaluate the analytical choices of the quantitative variables within the dataset.* -->\n\nTo answer Question 1, a minimal clinically important difference is required for the CLSS. In the original study protocol, a 2-point difference was put forward as a difference sufficient to represent clinically meaningful change in the CLSS Total score (\\~10%).\n\n## STROBE \\[12\\] Statistical Methods:\n\n<!--# *Evaluate the appropriateness and robustness of the statistical techniques used for analysis.* -->\n\nThe participant flow chart was generated using the *consort* package (see STROBE 8).\n\nBaseline data was compared between groups of preemptive IDC (Yes \\| No) using student t-test for continuous variables and fisher exact test (binary categorical) or chi-square test (categorical with \\>2 categories) with correction for ties. Correction for multiple comparisons was implemented with the *Holm* method using the *gtsummary* package (v2.1.0) [@gtsummary].\n\nComplete case analysis of the CLSS Total involved an unadjusted comparison between pre and post scores using a paired t-test.\n\nA linear model was fitted to the imputed data using *stats* (v4.4.2) [@stats] with the following form.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nCLSSMod <- with(\n  MasterImp, \n  exp = lm(PostCLSS ~ PreIDC + BaseCLSS + Bilateral + Sex + AgeAtSurgery)\n    )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThe model was summarised using *gtsummary*.

of the study objectives.*\n\n-   Patient reported urinary symptoms appears to undergo little change before and after lower limb joint arthroplasty (paired t-test; alluvian plots of individual questions CLSS)\n\n-   Whether the operating surgeon chooses to preemptively catheterise a patient prior to the arthroplasty procedure is not significantly associated with patient-reported urinary symptoms at \\~2 weeks after lower limb joint arthroplasty (regression analysis)\n\n-   Whether a patient undergoes a reactive catheterisation for treatment of POUR may have a moderate relative influence on short-term patient-reported urinary symptoms. (sensitivity analysis of regression)\n\n## STROBE \\[19\\] Limitations:\n\n*Provide a thorough critique of the limitations of the study design, methods, and data.*\n\n-   The psychometric properties of the CLSS have not been fully elucidated in this specific population\n\n-   The model may not be sufficiently complex to capture the nuances of different trajectories in at-risk sub-groups\n\n-   Electronic data capture may have excluded certain subgroups from participating in the study\n\n-   COVID lockdowns impacted recruitment and particularly data collection patterns (phone, rather than electronic link). This may have contributed to measurement error in the postoperative CLSS and within-patient variability from baseline to post assessments.\n\n-   Lack of blinding of analysis may contribute to bias; mitigated through structured approach to data model and analysis\n\n## STROBE \\[21\\] Generalizability:\n\n*Evaluate the strength of evidence supporting the external validity of the findings.*\n\n-   The patient demographics are comparable to the literature \\[Need to Check\\]\n\n-   The procedure volume is comparable \\[Need to Check\\]\n\n-   The rate of POUR + ReactiveIDC is comparable \\[Need to Check\\]\n\n-   Baseline CLSS is reasonable for the demographics of the sample \\[Need to Check\\]\n\n## Comparison with Existing Literature:\n\n*Critically compare findings with previous research, assessing consistency and discrepancies.*\n\nThe risk of POUR after lower limb joint arthroplasty has been associated with preemptive IDC in some studies\n\n# Ethical Considerations:\n\n## Informed Consent:\n\n*Critically analyze the adequacy of procedures for obtaining informed consent from participants.*\n\nPatients provided written informed consent to participate. This was modified to verbal consent in the context of COVID lockdowns that occurred during the recruitment period.\n\n## Ethical Approval:\n\n*Evaluate whether the study received appropriate approval from an ethics committee or institutional review board.*\n\nHREC approval was provided by the local health district HREC committee (No: HREC/2020/QMS/67023). Approved 25-Aug-2020.\n\n## Privacy and Confidentiality:\n\n*Assess the adequacy of measures taken to protect participants' privacy and confidentiality.*\n\nAll interactions with patients were conducted by qualified clinical personnel within the hospital setting.\n\nPatient information collected for the study was stored in electronic cloud infrastructure with industry-standard security and safeguards. Relevant business agreements were in place to ensure appropriate handling of patient data, with patient confidentiality enhanced by study data being stored in a deidentified format for subsequent linkage during analysis.\n\n*Beneficence and Non-maleficence: Critically evaluate any potential risks or benefits to participants and how they were addressed.*\n\nThe possibility that patient-reported measures may detect clinically relevant changes in urinary pain and function was addressed by an electronic system created specifically for the study. The SHARKS registry, during the period of recruitment, was enhanced by electronic messaging between the data team and the clinical personnel interacting with enrolled patients. When patients submitted a web-based postoperative CLSS form, it was compared to their own baseline response and any change in the total score of \\>2 points was flagged for the clinical personnel to action. This prompted the registrar to prepare a referral for urology review for the patient.\n\n# Conflicts of Interest:\n\n## STROBE \\[22\\] Funding:\n\n*Assess the degree of transparency to which the source of funding and role of the funders have played in the study/article.*\n\nFunding for the study planning and analysis was provided by the QEII Orthopaedic Research Fund.\n\n## Disclosure:\n\n*Evaluate the transparency and completeness of disclosures regarding conflicts of interest among the study authors or sponsors.*\n\nCS declares institutional funding and consultancy for Johnson and Johnson and MatOrtho unrelated to the present work.\n\nAll other authors declare no conflicts of interest.\n\n## Potential for Biases:\n\n*Critically assess whether conflicts of interest could have influenced the study design, analysis, or interpretation of results.*\n\nStudy design, analysis and interpretation of the results has been conducted independently of any actual or perceived influence from listed funding sources.\n\n# References\n",
